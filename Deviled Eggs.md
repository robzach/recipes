# Miso Deviled Eggs
stolen/transcribed from Mark Bittman's *How to Cook Everything Vegetarian*, 2007

*4 servings*

Cut

**4 hard-cooked eggs**

in half lengthwise and remove the yolks.

Mash the yolks with

**2 Tbsp mayo**,<br>
**1 heaping tsp mild miso like white or yellow**,<br>
**2 Tbsp minced scallion**, and<br>
**salt**.

Taste and adjust seasoning.

Spoon the filling back into the whites (using a pastry bag, or a plastic bag with the corner cut off, helps).

Sprinkle with paprika and serve or cover and chill, well wrapped, for up to 1 day before serving.

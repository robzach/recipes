# Morning Gloop
by RGZ

*Yields 1.5 pints; 1 pint is a serving for RGZ*

Add

**~2 C frozen chopped spinach** and <br>
**~2 C soymilk**

into a blender. Then add

**2 Tbsp peanut butter**

and blend until relatively smooth, perhaps 30 seconds. (Adding the peanut butter second means it won't stick to the walls of the blender.)

Add

**2 servings protein powder** and<br>
**1â€“5 tsp peanuts, almonds, cocoa powder, ground coffee, cocoa nibs, sunflower seeds, or anything else you want**

and blend again until it reaches desired smoothness.

Finally, add

**1 banana**

and blend in.

Pour into a Trader Joe's Vodka Sauce jar, put in your backpack's bottle pocket, and bike to school. Drink ostentatiously.

Can keep for ~5 days in the fridge.

# Shishito appetizer
from EGZ

Put the

**shishito peppers**

in a bowl and add some

**olive oil**

so that they're covered entirely.

Heat a cast iron skillet to medium.

Put the peppers in the skillet, allowing each of them to char/brown on one side, which might take a few minutes. Then use some tongs to turn them individually over to the other side and do the same. Some will be dark brown or black, some will be golden brown. (They won't be brown in places because they're not flat.)

Place on a serving piece and

**salt**

generously.

*Makes 4–5 servings. Takes 30 minutes to prepare.*

## Rice

Start cooking your rice when you start to prepare the curry. About 

**2 1/2 C raw rice**

should be enough for this amount of curry.

## Curry

Heat 

**2 Tbsp. oil or butter**

in a large, heavy skillet. Add

**1 tsp. sesame seeds**.

When seeds start to pop, add

**1 1/2 C onion, chopped**,<br>
**1 tsp. salt**,<br>
**1 tsp. turmeric**, and<br>
**dash of cayenne**.

Cook, stirring until onion is translucent.

Add

**eggplant, 6 C cubed**.

Stir regularly, about 15 minutes, until eggplant is soft, but pieces are still separate and whole.

Additional oil or a little water might be needed, if mixture is too dry.

Add half of

**1 Tbs. fresh coriander leaves, minced**

and cook 2–3 minutes.

Serve immediately, topped with remaining coriander and adorned with bright green peas.

# Senegalese Peanut Soup
transcribed/stolen from Mark Bittman's *How to Cook Everything Vegetarian*, 2007

*4 servings*

Heat in a saucepan

**2 Tbsp peanut or neutral oil, like grapeseed or corn**.

When hot, add

**1 medium red onion, halved and thinly sliced**,<br>
**1 Tbsp garlic, minced**, and<br>
**1 Tbsp fresh ginger, peeled and minced**.

Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft, 3–5 minutes.

Add

**1/2 C peanuts, roasted and shelled, which have been crushed with the flat of a knife**,<br>
**cayenne**, and<br>
**salt and pepper**.

Stir in

**6 C vegetable stock** and<br>
**2 sweet potatoes or yams (about a pound), peeled and cut into thick slices**,

bring to a boil, and lower heat so soup bubbles gently. Partially cover the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are just tender, about 10 minutes.

Stir in

**8 to 12 plum tomatoes, cored and halved (canned are fine)**,<br>
**1/2 lb. collards or kale, torn into medium sized pieces**, and<br>
**1/4 C chunky peanut butter**.

Cover and cook until the collards/kale are tender, 5–8 minutes.

Garnish with

**1/4 C peanuts, roasted and shelled, which have been crushed with the flat of a knife**

and serve.

as dictated by EGZ to RGZ December 30th, 2017

*Serves 6 as a side*

Quarter

**7 red bliss potatoes**,

boil them maybe 20 minutes, until a meat fork or knife goes in smoothly.

Halve and cut into bites

**10 carrots**

and boil them until cooked thoroughly, probably about 20 minutes.

Roast

**5–6 beets**

at about 400ºF for ~1 hour or 1:15, until soft.

Cut the potatoes and beets into 1" bites when cool and place in large bowl with the carrots.

Cut "into commonsense slices" and add to bowl:

**5 eggs, hard-boiled**,<br>
**2 cucumbers, diced and skinned**,<br>
**6 brown tomatoes**,<br>
**4 scallions**,<br>
**fresh dill**, and<br>
**fresh parsley**.

Tumble everything.

**Salt and pepper**.

Dress with a vingaigrette:

**apple cider vinegar**,<br>
**wine vinegar**,<br>
**olive oil**,<br>
**pepperhouse mustard**, and<br>
**a little lemon juice**.

Adjust seasonings. ("Oh, it's not vinegary enough. Oh, it's not peppery enough.")

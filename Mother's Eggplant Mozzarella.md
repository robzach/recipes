# Mother's Eggplant Mozzarella ("muzzarella")
as taught to her eldest in the kitchen on December 23rd, 2017

*Serves 4 people.*


**3 eggplants**

wash skin & dry, cut into rounds about 1/2" thick, discard ends without seeds.

Place eggplant slices on cookie pans. 

Whisk together:

**~1/2 C balsamic vinegar** and<br>
**~1/2 C olive oil**

Use a pastry brush to apply this to the eggplant. 

**Salt and pepper** the slices, with emphasis on pepper.

Turn each slice over and on the other side repeat the application of the oil/vinegar and salt and pepper.

Bake for 25 minutes at 370ºF. They're done when the eggplant yields to a fork and is relatively soft, but not rubbery.

## While the eggplant is cooking

### Combine in a mixing bowl:

**1 jar sundried tomatoes** chopped and drained of oil,<br>
**~3 ozs. tomato paste**,<br>
**3 cloves of garlic**, minced.

Add

**2–3 ozs. old red wine**,

until it's got the consistency of a thick sauce.

### Cut 

**2 fresh mozzarella balls** 

into slices ~1/4" thick. They should be about the same size as the eggplant slices.

## To each cooked eggplant slice, add:

A mozzarella slice, and a good dollop of tomato mush.

Top with

**Parmisiano Reggiano**

Bake for 5 minutes more at 370ºF, just to melt the mozzarella.

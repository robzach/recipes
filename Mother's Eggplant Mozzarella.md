# Mother's Eggplant Mozzarella ("muzzarella")
as taught to her eldest in the kitchen on December 23rd, 2017

Take

**3 eggplants**

wash their skin, dry, cut into rounds about 3/4" thick, discard ends without seeds.

Lay the eggplant slices on cookie pans. 

In a bowl, mix

**~1/2 C balsamic vinegar* and
**~1/2 C olive oil**,

using a whisk to mix them. Then use a pastry brush to apply this to the eggplant. Turn each slice over and repeat.

**Salt and pepper** the slices, with emphasis on pepper.

Bake the eggplant slices for about 22 minutes at 370ºF. They're done when the eggplant yields to a fork and is relatively soft, but not rubbery.

Chop up

**1 jar sundried tomatoes** (drained of oil)

and combine in a mixing bowl with

**~3 ozs. tomato paste**,

mixing these together with a spoon.

To this, add

**1–2 ozs. old red wine**

until when you stir it around it's a soft, mushy mix.

Cut 

**fresh mozzarella ball** 

into slices ~1/4" thick, and lay the slices right onto the eggplant slices; they should be about the same size as the eggplant slices.

Spoon the sundried tomato mush onto the mozzarella slices, and add some

**chopped garlic**

into the mix as well. Sprinkle

**Parmisiano Reggiano**

onto the top of the tomato mush.

Bake for about 5 minutes at 370ºF, just to melt the mozzarella.

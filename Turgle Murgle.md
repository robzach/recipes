# Turgle Murgle

By Zach

A slight modification to the classic [Guggle Muggle](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/19/1220080531/gogl-mogl-eastern-european-home-remedy-cold) (גאָגל-מאָגל), adding golden milk with turmeric base as an ingredient (hence the name)

I tried it for the first time on March 23, 2024 and was pretty happy with the result.

## 1. Make Golden Milk

### If you have fresh turmeric

(which is what they recommend), warm up

**2 C fake milk**

in a small pot.

Use a microplane (if available) to finely grate

**1–2 fingers of fresh turmeric**.

Add the turmeric, plus

**some black pepper, freshly ground**,<br>
**1 tsp coconut oil**, and<br>
**1–2 tsp honey or maple syrup**

to the milk.

Maintain low to medium heat, stirring occasionally, for a while (maybe 20 minutes). It should turn a very nice orange yellow.

### If you don't have fresh turmeric

You can use powdered turmeric and other spices; this blend stolen from [The Minimalist Baker](https://minimalistbaker.com/4-ingredient-golden-milk-mix/) but you can't go too wrong. Add the following to your warm milk and mix well:

**4 Tbsp ground turmeric**,<br>
**2 tsp ground ginger**,<br>
**2 tsp ground cinnamon**,<br>
**1 tsp ground black pepper**,<br>
**1 tsp coconut oil**, and<br>
**1–2 tsp honey or maple syrup**

### Or use a premade mix

Instead of making the dry mix yourself, there are also good golden milk powdered mixes available; just do what the jar says (which should still involve adding coconut oil and sweetener).

## 2. Murgle

Add

**1 yolk**

into a mug. Break it up with a whisk.

Make sure your golden milk is nice and hot, and then pour a small amount of it into the mug, while constantly mixing. (Start with maybe just half of an ounce or something.)

Continue slowly drizzling the golden milk into the mug while mixing with the whisk.

Drink in, or to your, good health.

## 3. But why stop there

I also added cocoa powder to the golden milk, *and* poured some fresh espresso into the turgle murgle. It put me into a very good mood and likely added years to my life.

I was thinking about blending some banana in there, too. You think I'm kidding, but I'm not.

At 375ºF, roast

**1 large butternut squash** and<br>
**2 medium sweet potatoes**

until soft.

Meanwhile, in a large pot, sautee the following in some olive oil:

**cumin seeds**,<br>
**ground turmeric**,<br>
**ground coriander**,<br>
**ground cumin**,<br>
**cinnamon**, and<br>

After two minutes, add

**chopped garlic** and<br>
**fresh chopped ginger**.

Once the stuff in the pot is softened (~10 minutes), add

**some vegetable stock**,<br>
**1 chopped apple**, and<br>
**1–2 bay leaves**.

Once the squash and potatoes are cooked, take them out of the oven, remove the seeds from the squash, remove the skin from squash and potatoes, cut into large pieces and put them into the soup.

Simmer for ~10 minutes.

Remove bay leaves.

Blend.

Add salt, pepper, and water to taste and texture preference.

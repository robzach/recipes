# Chocolate Avocado Pudding
as stolen from All Recipes: allrecipes.com/recipe/234324/chocolate-avocado-pudding

*Makes 4 servings.*

Blend together in a food processor:

**2 large avocados**,<br>
**1/2 C unsweetened cocoa powder**,<br>
**1/2 C brown sugar**,<br>
**1/3 C coconut milk**, and<br>
**2 tsp vanilla extract**.

Refrigerate.

Maybe top with

**pinch ground cinnamon**

if you want, but it's not necessary. Maybe also try some

**cayenne**?

I haven't, but it sounds good.

# Molly's Stovetop Egg Custard

By Molly  
as told to RKZ on 12/10/23 (three years to the day after we closed on our house in Edgewood!)

Warm

**1 C milk** and<br>
**1 Tbsp cornstarch**<br>

in a small pot.

In a separate bowl, whisk

**1 egg + 1 yolk**.

Whisk a few tablespoons of the heated milk into the eggs, which is called "tempering." Add a bit of milk, keep stirring, add a bit more, etc.

"The best thing you can do for custard is not heat it too fast."

Then, slowly add the egg mixture back into the milk on the stove, stirring the whole while. If you add it too quickly, you'll just have scrambled eggs and milk.

Maintain low heat, stir, and then raise the heat a bit until it's at medium.

Add

**a teaspoon of maple syrup**

and 

**a bit of vanilla extract**.

Keep stirring continuously as it thickens and pour out into a bowl.

Drizzle a bit more maple syrup on top.

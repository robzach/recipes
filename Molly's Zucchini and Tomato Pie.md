Thaw (or make)

**a pie crust**

and preheat oven to 375ºF.

Meanwhile, thinly slice

**1 large zucchini**,<br>
**2 medium tomatoes**, and<br>
**1/2 large onion.**

In a small skillet, heat

**~1/3 C olive oil**.

Once it is hot, add

**3–4 chopped cloves of garlic**,<br>
**thyme**, and<br>
**oregano**.

Fry these, stirring, until garlic is translucent. Then turn off the heat.

Once the crust is ready, place it into a pie dish. Poke at the bottom of it with a fork to discourage bubbles from forming underneath it.

## Build a layer

Build a layer of zucchini slices, overlapping a bit, on bottom. Then add some onion slices on top, and then tomato slices on top of that.

Drizzle hot olive oil from the skillet onto the layer, using a spatula to transfer garlic pieces if they don't flow on their own.

Squeeze some 

**lemon juice** 

over the layer, and add some 

**sliced parmesan** 

on top as well.

Finally,

**salt** and **pepper**.

## Build another layer in the same fashion on top of the first.

Once you've got two layers complete, fold in the edges of the crust and put into the oven.

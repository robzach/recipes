# Ana Mendez's *Berengena Horneada* (Roasted Eggplant)
as told to RGZ in Hunts Point on 6/15/12 (later reworded)

## Sauce

Cook in a pot on the stovetop until mushy:

**tomatoes, peeled**.

Then add

**garlic**,<br>
**oregano**,<br>
**sea salt**,<br>
**black pepper**, and<br>
**olive oil**.<br>

## Assembly

Load a baking pan with

**white onions, cut into circles**,

covering the whole bottom of the pan. Fill in spaces with chopped white onion.

Then make a layer of eggplant: use a peeler to peel

**an eggplant, preferably harder/firmer**,

and cut it into 1/8" or so slices.

Add the sauce on top and finish with

**optional mozzarella**.

Add water to the corners of the pan.

## Baking

Cover, bake at 350ÂºF for 20 minutes, until the knife pokes through the stuff and that means it's done. Should need a maximum of 30 minutes of baking.
